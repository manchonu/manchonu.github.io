                            </li>
                            My core competency is driving growth through digital transformation and data science. It's not about a machine learning model, a technique, or a project; it's at program level with complex combination of various domain knowledge, and requires collaboration with SMEs from different BUs. My education in Computer Science and Machine Learning provides me the deep understanding in technology, while my business experience enables me to design and architect solutions that meet business needs and package the solution in a way that can be understood by non-technical business stakeholders.

                                <strong>What are your career goals?</strong>
                            </li>
                            I like to inspire (and being inspired by) others, to introduce them what I've learnt from my experience and work with them together to transform concepts into materialized business results. I hope my TMs treat me not as a Manager, but a Mentor. To achieve that, I really enjoy working in an organization that the executive team believes in data and intelligent technology.
                            <p> </p>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Are you open to Advisory work?</strong>
                            </li>
                            Yes. My main career path is with large corporations, but in the past few years I also helped startups for building up data science practice or for executing digital transformation. My personal connections with Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists also provides me quite some stories, from which I learned about the caveats to watchout when building a startup.
                            <p> </p>

                            </li>
                            Research experience: Presented to hundreds of audience, majority of them are Researchers and/or Scientists.
                            <br> Industrial experience: Different levels, including C-Suite (mainly CMO, CDO, CIO, CFO, CCO, COO, and/or President). Depends on the topic, including but not limited to: Research/Technology POC, CapEx budget request, Business Performance. Mainly responsible to present complicated scientific/math to business stakeholders in a business understandable language with potential business actions, or to inspire discussions/questions.

                                <strong>Are you still hands-on? If yes, how do you keep yourself updated?</strong>
                            </li>
                            Do you mean can I code? can I architect? can I build model? Yes to all, and I love to. Being hands-on is more than just coding tho, it also involves analytical thinking, business acumen, and technical sense. I try to keep myself always updated with latest technology and tech topics, through attending conference, reading blogs/research papers/magazines, and to chat with tech friends. This allows me to make sure I know what's going on in the world. At work, I don't code everyday anymore... but I allow my TMs to periodically assign random tasks to me (coding, modeling, data cleansing, etc.), so that I can stay hands-on and be part of the team, do it rather than say it.

                            </li>
                            Generally speaking, I've been using SQL and Python the most in the past few years, while still fixing some codes in Java occasionally. Depends on which project or task I got involved, the required programming language can be very different: SQL, Python, R, Java, SAS. At the end of the day, programming language is just a tool, one can forget about the syntax, but not the logic behind.
