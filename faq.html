                            </li>
                            My core competency is driving strategic growth and data practice through digital transformation and data science, with robust CX and data intelligence strategy roadmap. It's not about a machine learning model, a set of technology solutions, or a project; it's a combination of data, technology, and various domain knowledge; which requires collaboration with SMEs from different areas. My background in Computer Science and Machine Learning provides me the deep understanding in technology, while my business experience in Technology, Travel & Hospitality, and FinTech sectors enables me to design and architect solutions that meet strategic business needs and package the solution in a way that can be understood by non-technical business stakeholders.

                                <strong>What are your career goals?</strong>
                            </li>
                            I like to inspire (and being inspired by) others, to introduce them what I've learnt from my experience and work with them together to transform concepts into materialized business results. I hope my team members treat me not as a Manager, but a Mentor. To achieve that, I really enjoy working in an organization that the executive team believes in data and intelligence technology solutions. 
                            <p> </p>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Are you open to Advisory work?</strong>
                            </li>
                            Yes. My main career path is with large corporations, but in the past few years I also helped higher education institutions, startups, and business councils for building up data science practice and/or for executing digital transformation. My personal connections with Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists also provides me quite some stories, from which I learned about the caveats to watchout when building a "SWAT" team.
                            <p> </p>

                                <strong>Are you bound to a specific industry?</strong>
                            </li>
                            No. People who concern about this usually indicate that s/he has not yet had a chance to implement large scale data or technology/digital transformation programs, or has not yet had a chance implementing such in more than one industry. You have Subjects (human, product, etc.)? you have Actions? you have Growth Expectation? Great! You are not that special then. That's also why there are technical and non-technical team members in an organization, the key is culture and collaboration. Remember two things: (1) The gold is in the signal, not the data (2) People drive technology and transformation, not the other way around. Refer to my <a class="aBlue" target="_self" href="life.html">LIFE JOURNEY</a> page, all the offers I received previously were from very different industries.

                            </li>
                            Research experience: Presented to hundreds of audience, majority of them are Researchers and/or Scientists.
                            <br> Industrial experience: Different levels, from fresh graduates to C-Suite (mainly CMO, CDO, CIO, CFO, CCO, COO, and/or President). Depends on the topic, including but not limited to: Research/Technology POC, CapEx budget request, Business Performance. Mainly responsible to present complicated scientific/math to business stakeholders in a business understandable language with potential business actions, or to inspire discussions/questions.

                            </li>
                            Do you mean can I code? can I architect? can I build model? Yes to all, and I love to. Being hands-on is more than just coding tho, it also involves analytical thinking, business acumen, and technical sense. I try to keep myself always updated with latest technology and tech topics, through attending conference, reading blogs/research papers/magazines, and to chat with tech friends. This allows me to make sure I know what's going on in the world. At work, I don't code everyday anymore... but I allow my TMs to periodically assign random tasks to me (coding, modeling, data cleansing, etc.), so that I can stay hands-on and be part of the team, do it rather than say it.

                            </li>
                            Generally speaking, I've been using SQL and Python the most in the past few years, while still fixing some codes in Java occasionally. Depends on which project or task I got involved, the required programming language can be very different: SQL, Python, R, Java, SAS. At the end of the day, programming language is just a tool, one can forget about the syntax, but not the logic behind.
